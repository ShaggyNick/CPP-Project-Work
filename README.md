# C and C++ work

I have added C++ code I worked on for two large projects I participated in my freshman year of Ohio State University, the Software Design Project and the Robot Competition Project. Descriptions below:

## Software Design Project
Me and a teammate wrote C++ code that would run on an [OSU Proteus Microcontroller](https://u.osu.edu/fehproteus/). We created a prototype video game that would run on either the microcontroller itself or on the Simulator given to us by the university (check the website for more details on the simulator).

### Description of Project:

This game is inspired by the online game, Club Penguin Karate, playable on the Proteus Simulator.

The player penguin gets 5 random cards with different elements and levels, and they have to use these cards to battle another penguin (the computer) to see who can win.

Object-Oriented Programming Logic is included with class "Card" and the necessary functions to play the game. Documentation of all the FEH functions used can be found [here](https://u.osu.edu/fehproteus/programming-syntax/).

## [Robot Competition Project](https://eed.osu.edu/academics/first-year-engineering-program/fundamentals-engineering-competitions/robotics-competition)
Me and three other teammates worked together in buliding a robot that would complete tasks in a specified environment as quickly as possible. 

Work on the robot's code, physical labor, budgeting of parts, SolidWorks simulations, documentation of progress and thought processes, etc. was split up amongst the group. Me and one other developer were in charge of the code portion and worked almost equally on the code.

Additionally, I did a large section of writing the final report paper which contained hundreds of pages with detailed sections, figures, and descriptions of the project's process.

## Description of Code:
Using the same OSU Proteus Microcontroller from before (except this time, utilizing several more libraries), the Robot would move around the course. 

The environment given to us by OSU faculty included a Robot-Positioning-System (RPS) that would return an X and Y coordinate of where the robot is. Using this and several calculated constants after weeks of testing, we created code with a very high success rate of the robot completing several tasks using the physical parts we added to the robot.
